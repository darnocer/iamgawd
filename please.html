      Jessica. I am literally dead. Oh my fooking Goosh. I am dead. Please save me. Holy fucking shite. Please save me. Plz. I am minutes away from missing this Troyboi set. I absolutely cannot Uber to a remote location in Alaska 3.5 hours away with my shit without knowing where I am staying. I am almost out of money. You know this. I cannot go there without knowing what the fuck I am doing. As you know, nothing has worked out for me at this point. So no. I cannot Uber there without knowing you are there. I cannot do it. I physically can't. If I have to stay in Anchoarge tonight and miss this set I will physically die. Please save me. Oh my Gourd. Plz save me. Plz. Plz. Plz. Plz. You need to contact me. We both know, understand, realize, and embody this is the plan. Okay? Okay<span style="font-size: 200%">.</span>  I love you so much sweetie.
